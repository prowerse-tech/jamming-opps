# .NET Core Exercise

```
TIMEBOX:    2-3 hours max. We mean it!
LANGUAGES:  C#
FRAMEWORKS: .NET Core, Feel free to use any UI library if want to.
TESTS:      minimum one, maximum infinite
DOCS:       nice to have, but not mandatory
```

# Overview

This exercise is to implement the best possible solution to one of the exercises below in the time alloted. We're evaluating your ability to take a set of requirements and spike a holistic solution that demonstrates craftsmanship, thoughtfulness and attention to user experience. 

This is **NOT** a test of how well you know .NET, nor should you try to impress us with overly clever and obtuse solutions. If you want to impress us, build something that is beautiful, intuitive and easy to debug/test/extend :smiley: .

Ideally your solution would have some way to run locally and visualize the results in a browser so we can fully analyze the experience and not just the source code.

## Exercise: Create Simple Automotive Workshop Management System

### As a workshop manager I want to

* See list of all my customers (Bonus - Can search particualr customer)
* See list of all vehicles belonging to my customer 
* See list of vehicles due for service in coming week (Bonus - Can sort vehicle by service due date)
* Book a slot in workshop for vehicle. Everyday only 4 slots can be booked.
---------

## Intentional Ambiguity (Read Carefully)

Some requirements are intentionally **underspecified** (e.g., service duration,  or what “due for service” exactly means).  

You are expected to:
- Make reasonable assumptions
- Clearly document those assumptions
- Design the system based on them  

There is no single “correct” interpretation.

---
## Design & Reasoning (Required)

Along with your code, include a short `DECISIONS.md` or a section in your README that answers:

- What assumptions did you make that were not explicitly stated?
- What did you intentionally **not** implement, and why?
- Which part of your solution are you least satisfied with?
- If you had more time, what would you improve first?

We care more about **thinking and judgment** than feature completeness.

---
## Constraints (Choose One)

Design your solution by prioritizing **one** of the following constraints:

- Simplicity and readability for junior developers
- Ease of future change and extension
- Correctness over performance

Clearly state which constraint you chose and how it influenced your design.

---

## Follow-Up Scenario (No Extra Coding Required)

Include a short written answer to this scenario:

> A bug is reported:  
> “Two vehicles were booked into the same slot on the same day.”
>
> Explain:
> - Where you would first look in your system
> - How you would reproduce the issue
> - How you would prevent it from happening again
